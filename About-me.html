My experience includes developing scalable applications, designing APIs, working with databases, and ensuring system security through modern best practices.</p>
                    <p>I've had the opportunity to collaborate with talented developers, designers, and data specialists â€” experiences that have strengthened my ability to work across disciplines and lead projects from concept to deployment. Beyond coding, I'm deeply interested in cybersecurity, AI, and how technology shapes the future of digital innovation.</p>
